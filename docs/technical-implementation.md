# Smart Meeting Assistant Technical Implementation

Language:
- English: `technical-implementation.md`
- 简体中文: [zh/technical-implementation.md](zh/technical-implementation.md)

This document explains how the current repository implements the five baseline requirements from [`docs/requirements/project-requirements.md`](requirements/project-requirements.md), plus the product and engineering capabilities that have been added around them.

## 1. System Architecture

The project uses a React/Electron frontend, a FastAPI backend, third-party or demo AI providers, and SQLite persistence.

```

`backend/app/main.py` is the backend composition root. During FastAPI lifespan startup, it creates provider clients, workflow services, SQLite history storage, upload processing, and the live `SessionManager`, then exposes them through `app.state`.

## 2. Requirement-To-Implementation Map

| Requirement | Main implementation | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Realtime speech-to-text with speakers | `useAudioRecording.ts`, `useWebSocket.ts`, `/ws/meeting`, `SessionManager`, `ASRProviderService`, ASR clients, diarization services | Frontend streams 16 kHz PCM audio to FastAPI; backend forwards audio to the selected ASR provider; speaker labels come from Volcengine, demo data, or DashScope plus diarization. |
| Meeting summarization | `SummaryService`, `MeetingSummary`, `SummaryPanel.tsx` | Final transcript rows are sent to the configured LLM or demo client; JSON is parsed, cleaned, augmented, persisted, and rendered. |
| Transcript translation | `TranslationService`, `DashScopeClient.translate_text`, `SessionManager._consume_translations`, `TranscriptPanel.tsx` | Final transcript rows are translated to one selected target language and saved with the transcript row. |
| Context-aware action items | `SummaryService`, `ActionItem`, `ActionItemsPanel.tsx`, meeting history APIs | The model returns action items; backend rules filter and augment them; the frontend supports editing and completion status updates. |
| Sentiment and engagement analysis | `SentimentAnalysisService`, `MeetingAnalysis`, `MeetingAnalysisPanel.tsx` | The backend creates incremental and final meeting-level analysis snapshots, with rule fallback for obvious interaction signals. |
| Persistent terminology glossary | `GlossaryStoreService`, `GlossaryService`, `/api/glossary/terms`, `MeetingProcessingSettings.tsx` | Saved glossary terms are stored in SQLite and automatically merged into live and upload meetings before per-meeting correction, summary, and analysis prompts run. |

## 3. Live Meeting Workflow

The live workflow starts in `frontend/src/app/App.tsx`:

1. The frontend builds a WebSocket URL with `scene`, `target_lang`, and `provider`.
2. `useWebSocket.connect()` opens `/ws/meeting`.
3. `useAudioRecording.startRecording()` checks browser microphone and audio-processing support, gets microphone access, and starts browser audio processing.
4. The hook tracks microphone `ended` / `mute` / `unmute`, `AudioContext` state changes, page visibility, `pagehide`, and screen Wake Lock availability so mobile interruptions are surfaced to the user.
5. Audio is downsampled to 16 kHz PCM and sent as binary WebSocket frames.
6. `backend/app/api/websocket.py` accepts the socket and delegates to `SessionManager`.
7. `SessionManager.create_session()` creates a draft meeting in SQLite, starts ASR consumption, and emits `session_started`.
8. ASR segments are normalized into `TranscriptItem` rows, persisted, and emitted as `transcript` or `transcript_update`.
9. Final transcript rows can trigger translation, periodic analysis, and live rolling summaries.
10. On `{ "type": "finalize" }`, the backend finishes ASR, runs final speaker confirmation when enabled, emits final analysis and summary, marks the meeting finalized, and closes the socket.

## 4. ASR Provider Selection

`ASRProviderService` resolves the active ASR provider. Supported providers are:

- `volcengine`: default production ASR path with native speaker clustering.
- `dashscope`: DashScope Paraformer realtime ASR, optionally combined with offline or hybrid diarization.
- `demo`: deterministic local ASR used when `DEMO_MODE=1`.

The demo provider follows the same `ASRClient` / `ASRStream` protocol as real providers. This lets WebSocket sessions, uploads, summaries, translations, analysis, and history records run without external API keys.

When `provider=demo` is requested while `DEMO_MODE=0`, the backend stays on the demo provider and reports that it is not configured instead of silently pretending to use a real provider.

## 5. Speaker Diarization

Speaker handling has three paths:

- Volcengine can return provider-native speaker labels.
- DashScope with `DIARIZATION_MODE=offline` assigns speakers after the meeting ends by running pyannote.
- DashScope with `DIARIZATION_MODE=hybrid` can emit provisional live speaker updates through diart, then confirm final labels with pyannote after finalize.

The high-level setup is documented in [`diarization.md`](diarization.md). Detailed Windows diart setup is documented in [`diart.md`](diart.md).

## 6. Upload Meeting Workflow

The product upload path is `POST /api/meetings/upload`.

1. The frontend submits one audio file plus `scene`, `target_lang`, and `provider`.
2. The backend creates a `processing` meeting record with `source_type=upload`.
3. `UploadMeetingService` processes the file in a background task.
4. Non-demo uploads are converted to WAV with ffmpeg.
5. Demo uploads skip ffmpeg conversion and use deterministic transcript rows.
6. ASR transcript rows are persisted first so the frontend can show partial progress.
7. Translation, analysis, and summary are generated and persisted.
8. The meeting is marked `finalized` on success or `failed` on unrecoverable errors.

The frontend polls `GET /api/meetings/{meeting_id}` and renders transcript, analysis, summary, and action items in the same workspace used by live meetings. Runtime ASR, analysis, and summary failures are retried once before the upload is marked failed. The frontend keeps the selected file in memory during the current page session so failed uploads can be submitted again without storing raw audio in meeting history.

## 7. Meeting History

`MeetingHistoryService` stores local meeting history in SQLite. It persists:

- meeting metadata and status
- live/upload source type
- provider, scene, and target language
- transcript rows
- transcript translations
- meeting summary
- meeting analysis
- generated or manually edited titles
- manually edited speaker labels
- manually edited summary fields
- action item status/content updates

The history APIs support list, detail, title update, speaker rename/merge, summary update, action item status update, and deletion.

Speaker corrections are persisted through `PATCH /api/meetings/{meeting_id}/speakers` after a meeting reaches `finalized` or `failed`. The backend updates transcript rows, exact action item assignee references, and participant-level analysis rollups without rerunning LLM summary or analysis generation.

`GlossaryStoreService` uses the same local SQLite file to store global terminology terms. `GlossaryService.resolve_terms()` merges per-meeting terms, saved global terms, and `CUSTOM_GLOSSARY_TERMS` in that order, deduplicating by case-insensitive `term` and keeping the same 50-term processing limit.

Meeting notes can be exported from the summary panel as a Markdown file. The export is generated in the frontend from the displayed summary, meeting date, duration, risks, decisions, action items, and transcript references; no backend export endpoint is required.

## 8. Frontend State Model

`App.tsx` owns the main product state:

- current input mode: `live` or `upload`
- selected ASR provider, scene, and translation target
- live recording and finalization state
- active upload meeting state
- selected history meeting state
- transcript, summary, action item, and analysis display state
- saved glossary terms and per-meeting temporary glossary input

The top-level Live / Upload switch reuses the same result workspace. Historical meetings override the current live/upload view until the user exits history selection.

## 9. Configuration And Demo Mode

Configuration is environment-variable driven. Important variables include:

- `DEMO_MODE`: enables deterministic local demo providers.
- `DEFAULT_ASR_PROVIDER`: `volcengine`, `dashscope`, or `demo`.
- `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`: used by DashScope ASR, translation, summary, and analysis.
- `VOLCENGINE_ASR_APP_KEY` and `VOLCENGINE_ASR_ACCESS_KEY`: used by Volcengine ASR.
- `DIARIZATION_MODE`: `disabled`, `offline`, or `hybrid`.
- `MEETING_HISTORY_DB_PATH`: SQLite meeting history location.

`GET /api/health` reports `demoMode`, configured provider status, and available ASR providers.

## 10. Tests And CI

Backend tests use pytest and must run through `backend/.venv`. Existing coverage includes:

- summary parsing and action item extraction behavior
- diarization assignment behavior
- live WebSocket workflow
- upload workflow
- history persistence and migration
- demo provider health, WebSocket, upload, and disabled-mode behavior

The frontend uses Vitest with React Testing Library for interaction coverage. Current frontend tests cover upload status messaging, ASR provider options, upload control state, summary editing, Markdown meeting notes export, and export formatting. `npm run build` remains the primary bundle verification step.

The Windows-first CI workflow installs backend and frontend dependencies, runs backend pytest, runs frontend tests, and builds the Vite frontend.

## 11. Demo Screenshot Refresh

Demo UI screenshots live in `docs/assets/screenshots/` and are linked from both README files. Refresh them only from demo mode so the images do not require external provider keys.

Recommended flow:

1. Start the backend with `DEMO_MODE=1`, `DEFAULT_ASR_PROVIDER=demo`, `DIARIZATION_MODE=disabled`, and a temporary local `MEETING_HISTORY_DB_PATH`.
2. Build the frontend with `cd frontend` and `npm.cmd run build` on Windows PowerShell.
3. Use the existing Electron dependency to load `frontend/dist/index.html` and capture the live demo workspace, upload completion state, and saved meeting detail.
4. Wait for UI state changes to render before capture. In automation, wait for the expected text and then wait at least two `requestAnimationFrame` ticks before calling Electron `capturePage()`.
5. Commit only the final PNG files under `docs/assets/screenshots/`. Do not commit temporary capture scripts, local SQLite files, large recordings, or dependency upgrades for screenshot capture.

If PowerShell blocks `npm.ps1`, use `npm.cmd`. Electron does not need to be upgraded for screenshot refreshes; use the dependency already present in `frontend/node_modules`.

## 12. Current Boundaries

- Live rolling summaries are provisional and not persisted; the final summary is still generated after finalize or upload completion.
- Translation supports one target language per meeting.
- Mobile background and lock-screen recording is still controlled by the operating system and browser; the frontend detects common interruptions but cannot guarantee capture while suspended.
- Raw audio is not stored in meeting history.
- Upload processing is async but still in-process; there is no distributed worker queue.
- Upload retry is session-local in the frontend; after a page refresh, the user must select the audio file again.
- Sentiment and engagement analysis is meeting-level, not participant-level.
- Demo mode is for onboarding, local smoke tests, and CI. It does not represent real provider quality.
